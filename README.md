[00:01.09] Stranger things
[00:01.61] We're like, like we're stranger things (very far)
[00:04.81] We're stranger things (dream of places at)
[00:07.52] 'Cause that's just who we are
[00:09.06] We'd used to run around this ghost town
[00:12.00] Always thinking out loud
[00:14.22] Are we gonna get out
[00:16.48] I remember
[00:17.99] We dream of places that we could go
[00:20.75] Castles with the strange glow
[00:23.10] People that we don't know
[00:25.38] I remember
[00:27.03] We left a life
[00:28.00] That's ordinary from the start
[00:31.30] We looked for stranger things
[00:33.07] 'Cause that's just who we are
[00:35.85] Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
[00:39.77] Like I'm picturing now
[00:44.43] Castles glitter under Spanish skies
[00:48.89] But I'm just looking out for you tonight
[00:53.42] Snow white mountains in a foreign state
[00:57.70] Tell me someday we'll get there
[01:01.55] Someday
[01:11.00] Someday
[01:33.06] Ooh-ooh
[01:34.71] Ooh-ooh
[01:38.67] I see a Technicolor shadow
[01:41.49] Underneath your window
[01:43.94] Just in case you don't know
[01:46.15] I can see it
[01:47.95] You cast an unfamiliar day glow
[01:50.66] Different than what I know
[01:52.87] Shining like a halo
[01:55.20] I can feel it
[01:56.64] We turned our back on ordinary from the start
[02:00.98] We looked for stranger things
[02:02.74] 'Cause that's just who we are
[02:05.47] Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
[02:09.61] Show me the sky falling down
[02:14.25] Castles glitter under Spanish skies
[02:18.58] But I'm just looking out for you tonight
[02:23.11] Snow white mountains in an ancient place
[02:27.40] Tell me someday we'll get together
[02:31.55] Someday
[02:40.45] Someday
[02:43.33] Ay, ooh ooh
[02:46.28] Ooh ooh
[02:49.96] A stranger things
[02:52.30] We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
