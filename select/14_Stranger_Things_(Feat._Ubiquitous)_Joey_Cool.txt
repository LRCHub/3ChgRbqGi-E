Puerto Rico power down and out
Ain't nobody got no time for that

This could make you an insomniac
Police shooting everything that moves
Overseas' where you might find me at

Old man to be American
The most hated, we in first place
Country founded on some bullshit
Founding fathers all had slaves
About 12 just to be exact
That could make you have a bad day
But

Stranger things have happened
Can you believe I made it rapping?
This is more than I could fathom
I guess stranger things have happened
I considered travelin'
Someone compared my stino to a [?]
This is more than I could fathom
I guess stranger things have happened

Fire Kap because he took a knee
They can't come up with a fine for that?

Multiple people straight up drowned in that
Something like back in Katrina days
There's still people they can't find in that
I'ma be real (yuh)
I'm losing hope in humanity
But that's how I feel (yuh)
I don't see no kinda sanity
This is the deal
I'ma just go for my family
Whatever I will
This is the energy channeling
Positive vibes (yuh)
We need the positive vibes (yuh)
Look, go home, you're drunk
We need to call it a night
The road won't be bumpy, though
This is one hell of a ride
Let's get it and slide
This is one hell of a fight
But

Hollywood is a dirty place
Take some dick from the right dude you could make it big
And I probably shouldn't encourage hate
But hiding truth in the shadow is no way to live
Now while I worry and wide awake
For all of the people
My people pointin' they weapons at
Puerto Rico is the United States
Not the third world citizens living second class
First things first
Number one, arm dealer we got access
Uncle Sam he the fucking plug
We don't even know the half yet
Knock us down 'til the cameras drop
We oppose a code of access
Standoff up on Standing Rock
Afghanistan and Iraq
Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan
Where the next bomb plan to drop
North Korea seeing Syria
Kim coming with the hammer cocked
Now somebody gotta clear it up

And it ain't no plan to stop
Pray for us we could lose it all
Aim for us you could win a lotto
